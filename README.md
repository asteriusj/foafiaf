__FOAFIAF__: Friend Of A Friend Is A Friend - A community network mapping capability levergaing RDF Datasets for Social Graph visualization and analysis


## Network Map Vision
* Use of knowledge of community network enables better alignment 

## Network Map Goals
* Capacity to gather, share and use data, information and knowledge
* Capability to achieve discovery of network relationships

## Network Map Objectives
* Optimize engagement, communications and alignment of community networks
* Understand how community network thinks and engage with each other to better advocate ideas
* Facilitate and support network map use for effective community network  engagement

## Network Map Tools
* Tools to Curate, Organize and Discover Social Network Graph Relationships

## Capability Enabling Features
_The strategy objective is to develop and devliver software tools that enable community members to currate, organize and discover relationships from social graph data_

## Gathering Data
_Gather & Organize Data from many sources for community benefit_

### Data Collection
Data Collection of knowledge management elements of community entities and their relationships

#### Capture Projects and Tasks
* Ability to add project and task data as Linked Data entities (ala timetonote)
* Ability to add projects and tasks as related Linked Data entities with social graph entities

#### Capture Issues and Activites
* Ability to add issue and issue activity data as Linked Data entities
* Ability to add issues as related Linked Data entities with social graph entities

#### Capture Notes and Assign Tags
* Ability to add notes and tag data data as Linked Data entities (ala timetonote)
* Ability to add notes and tags as related Linked Data entities with social graph entities

#### Capture Meetings and Events
* Ability to add calendar event data as Linked Data entities (ala timetonote)
* Ability to add Linked Data relationships for calendar event with social graph entities

#### Import CRM Linked Data
* Ability to import a CSV file of predefined CRM contact data elements
* Ability to convert CSV file data into Linked Data triples with contact element, relationship and related element

#### Update FOAF Profiles


### Data Organization
Data organization usually happens based on certain rules. These rules are defined by the organization.

#### Manage Linked Data Groups & Categories
#### View, Modify or Remove Linkkd Data
#### Append and Enhance Linked Data


## Sharing Information
_Summarize & Analyse Information to Share with each other_

### Information Summarization
The information is summarized in order to take the essence of it. 

#### Publish Community Contacts Directory

#### Publish Community Organization Chart

#### Flexible Reporting Tool

#### Web and Mobile Assessibility
Users have ability for the Website to be Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Users of Mobile Devices
* Ability to use websites and applications more accessible to people with disabilities when they are using mobile phones including people using a broad range of devices by adherence and support of Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP)
* Ability to adhere to and support the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 Requirements and Responsibilities

#### Multichannel Publish  & Subscribe
Users have ability to Extend to mobile devices is critical. Subscribing to published data elements to have info reflected to device.
* Ability to subscribe to contact directory as vCard
* Ability to Subscribe to Calendar Events as iCal
* Ability to Publish vCard for contacts and directories
* Ability \Publish iCal for events and calendars

### Information Analysis
Information Analysis - the information is analyzed in order to find the relationships, redundancies and patterns.

#### Select Starting Point
The user has the ability to select a starting a source RDF 
* Ability to enter URL of an RDF dataset (B)
* Ability to upload and RDF dataset file (B)
* Ability to paste contents of an RDF dataset (B)
* Ability to convert RDF into JSON-LD format from XML, N3, TTL (A)

#### Visualize Linked Data
Users have ability to access graphic representation of community Linked Data, relationships between entities and view detailed properties of selected entities
* Ability to view metadata of primary RDF entity in UI panel (ala WebVowl)
* Ability to filter what RDF content is displayed via UI controls (ala WebVowl, LodLive)
* Ability to visualize nodes for FOAF class things represented by icons
* Ability to visualize nodes for FOAF property things represented as text
* Ability to visualize edges that connect nodes for RDF predicates as links
* Ability to visualize RDF graph Subject and Predicate as nodes
* Ability to visualize DRF graph Predicate as edges

#### View Linked Data Details
The user has ability to select an individual Linked Data item in visualization and view the items details, properties and values
* Ability to select an individual Linked Data item from graph or list visualization
* Ability to view detailed list of properies and values of a Linked Data item
* Ability to display node element in  detail when selected by user


## Using Knowledge
_Synthesize & Discover Knowledge to collaborate and engage_

### Knowledge Synthesis
Knowledge Synthesis where information becomes knowledge. The results of analysis (usually the reports) are combined together to derive various concepts and artefacts

#### Use and Append
#### Relationship Decision Support
#### Extend and Compare
Be able to upload my contact list to CRM, have map sugegst contacts in CRM that I should connect with (also LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc)


### Knowledge Discovery
Network analysis knowlwdge discovery methodology to analyze the relationship among nodes (e.g., people)

#### Interactive Navigation
* Ability to display node detail when selected by user
* Ability to show edges and 1 level connected nodes for node selected
* Ability to show 1 + n level connectections baased upon configuration of n degrees

#### Follow and Retrieve
* Ability to retrieve graphs via URI when needed by user actions
* Ability to store new RDF datasets in memory when retrieve via URI

#### Affitnity Impact Analysis
* Ability to understand ptential impact of a change in relationships (ala iServer)
* Ability to view relationsship degrees of seperation from a starting node (ala 6 Degrees)
